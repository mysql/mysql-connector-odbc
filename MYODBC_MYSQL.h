/*
  It doesn't matter to us what SIZEOF_LONG means to MySQL's headers, but its
  value matters a great deal to unixODBC, which calculates it differently.

  This causes problems where an application linked against unixODBC thinks
  SIZEOF_LONG == 4, and the driver was compiled thinking SIZEOF_LONG == 8,
  such as on Solaris x86_64 using Sun C 5.8.

  This stems from unixODBC's use of silly platform macros to guess
  SIZEOF_LONG instead of just using sizeof(long).
