#  Post Install file for MySQL Connector ODBC @CONNECTOR_MAJOR@.@CONNECTOR_MINOR@

##############################################################################

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# ENSURE WE HAVE INI FILES
#
# Upon a fresh install of OS X these files do not exist. The ODBC Installer
# library calls should create these files for us when we do stuff like
# request to register a driver but this does not seem to happen and the
# request fails. So we we start by making sure we have some, mostly, empty
# ini files in place before we make installer calls.
#
# Also note that there are many places where these ini files *could* go
# based upon the search algorithm in the default ODBC system or any other
# ODBC system which may get installed. We choose the following because they
# seem to be the ones created when we use the standard ODBC Administrator
# application.
